  <h2>Mirror Cube</h2>
  <p>The Mirror Blocks, also known as the Mirror Cube and Bump Cube, is a type of twisty puzzle and shape modification of the standard 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube and was invented in 2006. The puzzle's internal mechanism is nearly identical to that of the Rubik's Cube, although it differs from normal 3x3 cubes in that all pieces are the same color (typically reflective gold or silver stickers) and are identified by shape since each one is also a distinct rectangular prism.

Like the Ghost Cube and Mastermorphix, the mirror cube has a 3x3x3 shape, meaning that it can be solved the same way as the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. There are many unofficial world records for the fastest solve, the most recent of which being held by Sebastian HÃ¤fner, who solved the cube in 9.32 seconds. Due to the Mirror Blocks not being a WCA-sanctioned puzzle, records are more difficult to establish.[1][2][3][4]
